Homework 9: README Generator
This project uses Inquirer to prompt the user in the command line, capture their response to a series of questions and then render their answers in a README file. First it prompts the user using the question array. Then it uses a promise to pass the response to a custom node module called generateMarkdown. There I used a switch case to differentiate between the available licenses and display a clickable badge for each one. Then the function uses the file system to write a markdown file, correctly formatted and inserting all of the user entered values from the prompt. I have included a sample readme in the develop folder called generatedREADME.md and I have submitted a walkthrough video as well. Thanks for your time, I hope I get a good grade!!!
